      <h2>15 April 2018</h2>
      <p>After deciding to base our machine on a turntable, we researched methods of making our device a writing tool:</p>
      <p>

      </a>
      <p>Dimitri assembled a prototype for the pen-holding piece of the drawing arm, as well as attachments for the rotating
        motor.
      </p>
      <p>We were able to recycle the materials purchased for our Delta Bot plan, and used them in the making of our turntable
        device. </p>
      <p>In order to allow our motor to give the writing arm enough range in motion to create amplitudes for the waves large
        enough to appear clearly on the record, we added a small wooden disc to the top of our motor, and from there attached
        the metal arm.</p>
      <p>Sherman programmed the motor to function with Max, so that we were able to receive information from weather databases
        of our choosing. Our hope was for these values to reflect in different wavelengths on our record, as we were controlling
        the speed and direction of the motor from these weather values. </p>

      <p>Emily and Sherman cut several wooden discs for the motor part, as well as three larger discs to spin in place of the
        record on the turntable. Our aim was to draw directly onto these large wooden discs and record the oscillations from
        the turntable pin (holding the pen). We wanted physical records to document the live data we sourced, so we might
        be able to compare the discs recording weather from different cities, different days, and different parameters.</p>
      <p>
        In order to ground our machine to our theme, we found radial images that fit the tone of our project. We printed round satellite
        images of storms to place atop the wooden records we cut, such that the eye of the storm fell in the center of the
        disc.

      <h2>15 March 2018</h2>
      <p>We decided to shift our project's focus on constructing something that would be easier to build. While our intended
        final result has changed, our idea contains several similar characteristics in terms of the mechanics of the installation.
        Physical components such as stepper motors, manipulator rods and an Arduino microcontroller is still being used.
        Max 7 is being used to perform tasks that requires an internet connection while it uses serial data to communicate
        with the Arduino.</p>
      <p>We decided that a record player would be great for serving its purpose as a base for the mechanism, while creating
        an interesting visual to viewers of the artwork.</p>

      <h2>2 March 2018</h2>
      <p>We have been researching delta robots that are capable to draw on a surface. Inspired by the mechanics of 3D delta
        printers, we believed that the delta structure would work best for our installation. Therefore, we have done research
        regarding the mechanics of the delta robots and came to a revelation that we require parts like manipulator rods,
        stepper motors and ball-and-roller links.</p>
