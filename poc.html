      <h2>15 April 2018</h2>
      <p>After deciding to base our machine on a turntable, we researched methods of making our device a writing tool:</p>

      </a>
      <p>Dimitri assembled a prototype for the pen-holding piece of the drawing arm, as well as attachments for the rotating
        motor.
      </p>
      <p>We were able to recycle the materials purchased for our Delta Bot plan, and used them in the making of our turntable
        device. </p>
      <p>In order to allow our motor to give the writing arm enough range in motion to create amplitudes for the waves large
        enough to appear clearly on the record, we added a small wooden disc to the top of our motor, and from there attached
        the metal arm.</p>
      <p>Sherman programmed the motor to function with Max, so that we were able to receive information from weather databases
        of our choosing. Our hope was for these values to reflect in different wavelengths on our record, as we were controlling
        the speed and direction of the motor from these weather values. </p>

      <p>Emily and Sherman cut several wooden discs for the motor part, as well as three larger discs to spin in place of the
        record on the turntable. Our aim was to draw directly onto these large wooden discs and record the oscillations from
        the turntable pin (holding the pen). We wanted physical records to document the live data we sourced, so we might
        be able to compare the discs recording weather from different cities, different days, and different parameters.</p>
      <p>
        In order to ground our machine to our theme, we found radial images that fit the tone of our project. We printed round satellite
        images of storms to place atop the wooden records we cut, such that the eye of the storm fell in the center of the
        disc.

      <h2>15 March 2018</h2>
      <p>We decided to shift our project's focus on constructing something that would be easier to build. While our intended
        final result has changed, our idea contains several similar characteristics in terms of the mechanics of the installation.
        Physical components such as stepper motors, manipulator rods and an Arduino microcontroller is still being used.
        Max 7 is being used to perform tasks that requires an internet connection while it uses serial data to communicate
        with the Arduino.</p>
      <p>We decided that a record player would be great for serving its purpose as a base for the mechanism, while creating
        an interesting visual to viewers of the artwork.</p>

      <p>At this stage, we were focusing on ideal ways to make the apparatus move accurately according to our coordinates. We
        did research on various robots and writing devices, and came up with the idea of replicating the mechanics of Delta
        draw bots. We believed that the delta structure would work best for our installation. This way, we would have three
        directions from which to push and pull the apparatus. We ended up getting parts, such as manipulator rods, stepper
        motors and ball-and-roller links, in order to attempt replicating the mechanics of delta robots.</p>

      <h2>27 January 2018</h2>
      <p>On the first day of brainstorming, our group decided our theme for this project would be based upon the visualization
        of weather data. Motivation to choose this topic stemmed from our global climate crisis, and related weather concerns.
        We also knew right away that we wanted to build a writing device with which to visualize this data. We loosely conceptualized
        a brace-like circular frame that would grip an object (i.e.: a stone), with this object dragging across a piece of
        slate. We wanted to incorporate sound elements into this project, so the idea of creating a sound during the writing
        process arose. The friction between the stone and the slate would create a "nails on chalkboard" effect, a sound
        widely accepted to be unpleasant. </p>
      <p>The driving force behind this writing device would be motors, fed information from our weather databases. Our idea
        was to source various parameters such as wind, temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, etc., plug them into our code and
        control the motion of our machine. We first planned to suspend this frame from wires inside a box, with each wire
        controlled by its respective motor. With this apparatus setup, we hoped to "draw" the weather data, while also creating
        sound from the contact between the stone and the slate. With this plan we wished to create an audiovisual experience
        which would relay what was occurring with the weather, as well as emit a sound that conveyed the unnerving sense
        of urgency.</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Ij65tX3.jpg">

            </a>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>This idea too has several forms, all of which consisted of building a device that plotted weather data.
      </p>
      <a href="https://i.imgur.com/9K0UOuj.jpg">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/9K0UOuj.jpg">
      </a>
      <p>We then arrived at the idea of soundproofing a clear box to contain our project, recording the sounds of stone scratching
        slate as the machine worked, and convert this sound into a custom composition which would play on speakers outside
        the box. This way, we would be playing a completely different sound that what viewers would expect, while still providing
        a weather-responsive piece using live data.</p>
      <p>Emily made 3D renderings of our tool, which we planned on building.
