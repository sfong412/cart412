  <h2>An installation by Sherman Fong, Dimitri Kontogiannos and Emily Tooker.</h2>

<p>This project is inspired by several writing machines that have been created in the past. During our development process,
  we originally wanted to create an installation that would draw on its own. A writing utensil would be used, such
  as a pen, to draw on the surface below the installation. API data of the weather, such as the Weather Channel or OpenWeatherData,
  would influence the behaviour of the drawing process. We later decided to abandon the concept of drawing in favour of a more
  abstract behaviour, although the same mechanics would be used. </p>

<p>A historical work we looked at for inspiration was titled <i>The Writer</i>, an 18th century automata developed by watchmaker,
  Pierre Jaquet-Droz. Its complex mechanisms contained within are used to write designated text.</p>

<p>This example, <i>An Autonomous Writing Machine
  By Bill Hart</i>, is one of the more contemporary works that we looked at. Using a Raspberry Pi, old printer parts, 3D-printed parts, etc, this installation uses neutral networking to write text. The content this machine writes are the machine's fragments of thought.</p>

<p><i>Cloud Piano</i>, an installation by David Bowen, was an interesting example of weather data implementation. By sensing the movement of the clouds, an automated machine is situated near the piano, so that notes would play in corresponance to the weather data.</p>
