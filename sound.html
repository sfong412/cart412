      <p>The following three audio clips included in this page are proof-of-concept examples of the installation's sound. These
        clips were made as an exploration on what auditory mood we want to achieve for this installation. The sound portion
        of the installation will be generated using Max, due to its ability for incorporating sensory input for changing
        the output of the audio.</p>
